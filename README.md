#### Manage_MySQL_db_with_Python

This project demonstrates how to manage a MySQL database using Python. It covers basic operations like connecting to the database, creating tables, inserting data, querying data, and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The project uses SQLAlchemy for database interactions and Pandas for data manipulation.

Key Steps in the Project:  
📊 Extracted Data from Excel Sheets
Loaded data from Excel sheets into DataFrames using Pandas.

🔧 Processed the DataFrames
Cleaned, transformed, and prepared the data for further use, ensuring proper formats and handling of missing values.

🗄️ Created a MySQL Database
Created a MySQL database to store and manage the data programmatically.

📥 Inserted Data into the Database
Added DataFrames into MySQL tables using SQLAlchemy.

🔍 Executed Test Queries
Performed test queries to verify the correctness of the data and check the functionality of the database.

Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language.
MySQL: Relational database for storing data.
SQLAlchemy: Python ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interaction.
Pandas: Library used for data manipulation and querying.
